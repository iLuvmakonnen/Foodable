## Inspiration  
Imagine you are scrolling through your favorite social media site such as Pinterest or Instagram, and you come upon a photo of an amazingly delicious meal. So you click on the photo hoping to get a better look at just how tempting that dish acually is, and more importantly, if per chance that restaurant is close to you. But unfortunately, whoever posted this delectable delacacy, neglected, to attach the appropriate tags, or you are in Brooklyn, and that restaurant is in San Francisco. 

## What it does   
Well, don't panic, we've got your back. We created an app called Foodable. Foodable allows the user to upload a photo from anywhere, and utilizes image identification software paired with GPS (or user IP address if GPS is not available) to locate and provide a selection of near by venues which prepare a similar dish. 

## How to install
1 - Clone this repository by using the following command on your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/jayserdny/Foodable
```
2 - Once it is done, move to the app directory and execute the following command:
```
npm install
```
3 - Install uuid package by executing the following command:
```
npm install uuid
```
4 - Type the following command to reconstruct the app:
```
ionic state restore
```
5 - Preview the app by the following command
```
ionic serve
```

## What's next for Foodable  
In the future we wish to create a mobile ordering system that will allow customers to place orders directly from our application. Profits are expected to be generated based upon participating venues.
